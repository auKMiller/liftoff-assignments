# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is a page for an artist to upload and post work to be viewed and purchased by the public.
The artist will be able to add, delete, and edit photographs of their work, price, and descriptions.  
The artist will have their own page to upload an image of themselves and have an "about me" section. They 
may also choose to add an artist statement.

The customer will be able to view the artist page, the gallery, and each piece individually. 
They also will be able to add artwork to a test shopping cart. I had the idea because I am an artist and would like
to have my own online shop. 
### Features
1. Artwork viewer: Artist will be able to add, and delete artwork. Price and descriptions will be able to be editied.
2. Shopping cart: Artwork should be able to be added to a shopping cart. 
3. Artist page: Artist will have a space to post a picture and a description about them and their artwork.
4. Search feature (possibly): The artist (or user) could search by artwork type. Or possibly by Artist if I get that far. 
### Technologies
Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, Thymeleaf templates
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to create a shopping cart. I might be learning to use data from a API. I will also be learning how to integrate
JavaScript to make it more interactive, as well as some more html/CSS to make things pretty.
